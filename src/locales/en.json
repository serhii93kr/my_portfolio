    "description": "Hi! I'm Serhii, a passionate software developer with over 5 years of professional experience — and even more years of genuine curiosity. My journey in programming began back in 2008 with web templates and HTML/CSS, later evolving into full-stack web development with JavaScript and PHP. I've built custom CMS platforms, optimized and customized over 30 WordPress sites, and developed several commercial Android apps — one of which surpassed 12,000 downloads on Google Play.\n\nIn recent years, I've focused heavily on mobile development using Kotlin and Flutter, creating apps for e-commerce and AI-powered tools with ChatGPT API. I also have experience building Chrome extensions, working with microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP8266), and integrating modern AI technologies.\n\nI love turning ideas into working products — clean, efficient, and user-focused."
